Tic-tac-toe is a logic game between two opponents on a square field of 3 by 3 cells or larger (up to the "endless field"). One of the players plays with "crosses", the second - with "noes". The traditional Chinese game (Gomoku) uses black and white stones.

Rules of the game

Players take turns putting 3Ã—3 signs on the free cells of the field (one is always crosses, the other is always zeros). The first one to line up 3 of their pieces vertically, horizontally or diagonally wins. The first move is made by the player placing crosses.

Usually, at the end of the game, the winning side crosses out with a line its three characters (zero or cross), which make up a continuous row.

Analysis

Algorithms are well-known for each of the parties that guarantee a draw in any game of the opponent, and if he makes a mistake, they allow you to win. Thus, the game is in a state of "no man's death".

Below are some of these strategies. It is believed that the player always respects two rules that take precedence over all others:

Rule 1. If a player can win immediately, he does so.
Rule 2. If a player cannot immediately win, but his opponent could immediately win by making a move to a square, the player himself makes a move to that square, preventing an immediate loss.
