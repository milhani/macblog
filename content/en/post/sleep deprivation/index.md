Lack of sleep, as a rule, leads to serious consequences: hypertension, visual impairment, memory problems. The most common causes of sleep disorders are insomnia, mental disorders, heavy employment.

Most often, teens and young adults suffer from sleep deprivation, and for some of them, staying awake is a conscious choice. Once, 17-year-old Randy Gardner deliberately did not sleep for 11 days, and his result was entered into the Guinness Book of Records. The record was later broken by Maureen Weston, who did not sleep for 18 days.

According to the statistics of the public on VKontakte about sleep deprivation, most often people from 16 to 25 years of age intentionally do not sleep. The main causes of conscious interruption of sleep among young people are a test of their own strength, the appearance of hallucinations and the struggle with depression. Marathons are held in special groups in social networks, where participants do not sleep for several days (from 3 to 9 days) and along the way discuss the effects of long-term deprivation.

The states of altered consciousness that occur due to the interruption of sleep are similar to alcohol or drug intoxication. According to some studies, long-term sleep deprivation can cause addiction, which can subsequently lead to the use of psychoactive substances.
